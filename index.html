        <h1>The Peachiest Pub In Town!</h1>
        <h2>Frog & Peach Pub</h2>
        <h3>Frog and Peach Pub sells experiences. It opens in the evenings and is the hotspot in the college town where it is located, for drinking, mingling, and dancing. It is a small business and a small pub that has a big presence that will pull you in. It is in the heart of downtown SLO sandwiched between other bars. It has been around since 1994, and is being rebranded during the pandemic (2022) to appeal to its target audience. 20 somethings are the target audience of this pub. Frog and Peach is LGBTQIA+ friendly and often invites queer artists and QTPOC artists to come perform live for customers. The music is popular and there are regular throwbacks to the early 2000s and other decades. The drinks served at Frog and Peach have funny names that describe what each drink may persuade you to do, if you consume it. I think the image this pub wishes to achieve is a high energy, inclusive, place locals consider a go-to for their nights out.
            Due to the location of Frog and Peach, being in a row of bars in the middle of downtown SLO, it has a bit of direct competition. The small amount of bars and nighttime services/spots in general in the surrounding area however, aid their business. Some of their competitors include: Barrel House, The Library, Mccarthyâ€™s Irish Pub, Libertine, and Slo Brew Rock. Frog and Peach can make up for what the rest lack in originality and quality of music and entertainment.
